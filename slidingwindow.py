#sliding window technique is typically used when you're dealing with sequences (arrays or lists) and you need to find a subsequence that satisfies some constraint

#The 'for' loop is used to extend the right end of the sliding window.
#The 'while' loop is used to shrink the left end of the sliding window.
#'total' keeps the sum of the elements in the current window.
#'result' keeps the size of the smallest subarray that we've found so far.
