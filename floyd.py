#In this script, floyd is a function that implements Floyd's cycle detection algorithm. It takes a function f and a starting value x0 as input. It returns the length lam and position mu of the first repetition in the sequence.

#You can apply this function to many types of problems where you need to detect a cycle in a sequence of values. For example, you could use it to detect a cycle in a pseudo-random number generator, or to find a cycle in the sequence of states in a simulation or a game.
